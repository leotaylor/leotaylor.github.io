        <p>Having never experimented with the tools necessary for the creation of website, I felt completely overwhelmed learning about HTML and CSS as well as using the terminal and GitHub. However, I have to come to realize how necessary and useful these tools can be. I am certainly looking forward to having a better understanding of how to use these tools and create beautiful websites in the process.</p>
        <p>Throughout the tree house courses and the first couple of weeks of class, I have found HTML to be the least intimidating and easiest to learn. I feel like once you know the basic functioning of the language, then it becomes fairly intuitive. I like the way it interacts with CSS by way of setting classes and ids. However, I am still struggling to learn the difference between the two and how to create highest priority for certain elements.</p>
        <p>Overall, I find that CSS is very cool and versatile, but difficult to use. There are so many commands that do so many different things that is hard to remember what to use when and how to get certain commands to work correctly, such as floats. Setting colors, text size, and column/container widths to be fairly easy. However, when working with columns I have a hard time getting things positioned just right, especially once I start resizing the screen. I hope to get better at this as time goes on. I remember going over flexbox and bootstrap during the treehouse courses and thinking that those tools made styling much easier. I look forward to learning more about these tools in the class. </p>
        <p>And then there is GitHub and using the terminal in general. I found that I actually caught on to using the terminal pretty quick although I frequently make mistakes. The most common of which is not moving into the directory folder I had just created when trying to create files. GitHub, doesn’t make sense yet. I know how to make new repositories and branches. However, I have no idea what is actually going on. But, it is clear to me how useful it can be, especially when working on a team or updating a live website. However, I find that when making a website from scratch, it adds unnecessary steps while the site is not yet live. </p>
        <p>For the most part, I am excited about learning how to use these tools further and having them be a part of my daily professional career. The learning curve has been difficult at times and I’m sure nothing is getting any easier. But I welcome the challenge as I know it is going to allow me to acquire a fulfilling career. I just wish I had applied for Nashville Software School sooner! </p>
